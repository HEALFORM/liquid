  Liquid UI library codifies existing UI components into a central, well-maintained repository.
  It is built to address having to paste the same components into multiple projects again and again.
  This simplifies building UI's with HEALFORM's design patterns.
</Body>

## Basic Installation

If you're looking to begin developing a user-interface with Liquid, you can install the package directly via [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```bash
yarn add @healform/liquid
```

Or if you prefer [NPM](https://npmjs.com):

```bash
npm install --save @healform/liquid
```

## Usage

All components are exported via named exports - we don't have a default export. They can be imported at the top of any React file like such:

```javascript
import { Alert } from '@healform/liquid';
```

They can then be used in JSX like such:

```jsx
const MyGreatComponent = (props) => {
  const alertTitle = 'Aww yeah...';
  const alertStatus = 'success';
  const alertText = 'Nice job using an alert, you did it right!';

  return (
    <Alert title={alertTitle} status={alertStatus}>
      {alertText}
    </Alert>
  );
};
```
